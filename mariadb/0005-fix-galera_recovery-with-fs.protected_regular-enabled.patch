Subject: [PATCH 1/1] fix galera_recovery with fs.protected_regular enabled

The fs.protected_regular sysctls was added in Linux 4.19 to make some
data spoofing attacks harder. With systemd v241 these will be enabled
by default.

With this protection enabled galera_recovery fails with EPERM
(permission denied). This is caused by a wrong security measure:
The script changes ownership of $log_file to $user, though $user never
touches it. The shell redirection writes output to the file, not mysqld.
So just drop chown to fix this.
