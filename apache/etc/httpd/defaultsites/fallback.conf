##    SSL Virtual Host Context

    <VirtualHost *:443>

#         General setup for the virtual host
        DocumentRoot /srv/http/placeholders/nosuchsite

        # By default, redirect to http
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]
        # This also works for wildcard hostnames

#         SSL Engine Switch:
#         Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
        SSLEngine on

#         SSL Protocol support:
#         List the protocol versions which clients are allowed to
#         connect with. Disable SSLv2 by default (cf. RFC 6176).
        SSLProtocol all -SSLv2

#         SSL Cipher Suite:
#         List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
#         See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
        SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5

#         Speed-optimized SSL Cipher configuration:
#         If speed is your main concern (on busy HTTPS servers e.g.),
#         you might want to force clients to specific, performance
#         optimized ciphers. In this case, prepend those ciphers
#         to the SSLCipherSuite list, and enable SSLHonorCipherOrder.
#         Caveat: by giving precedence to RC4-SHA and AES128-SHA
#         (as in the example below), most connections will no longer
#         have perfect forward secrecy - if the server's key is
#         compromised, captures of past or future traffic must be
#         considered compromised, too.
#         SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA:AES128-SHA:HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5
#         SSLHonorCipherOrder on

#         Server Certificate:
#         Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
#         the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
#         pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  Keep
#         in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you
#         can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA
#         ciphers, etc.)
        SSLCertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server.crt"
#         SSLCertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server-dsa.crt"

#         Server Private Key:
#         If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
#         directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
#         you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
#         both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
        SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server.key"
#         SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server-dsa.key"

#         Server Certificate Chain:
#         Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
#         concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
#         certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
#         the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
#         when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
#         certificate for convenience.
#         SSLCertificateChainFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server-ca.crt"

#         Certificate Authority (CA):
#         Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
#         certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
#         huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
#         Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks
#               to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
#               Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
#         SSLCACertificatePath "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt"
#         SSLCACertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/ca-bundle.crt"

#         Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
#         Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client
#         authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
#         of them (file must be PEM encoded)
#         Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks
#               to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
#               Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
#         SSLCARevocationPath "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crl"
#         SSLCARevocationFile "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crl/ca-bundle.crl"
