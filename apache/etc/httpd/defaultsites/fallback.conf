        # By default, redirect to http
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]

#         SSL Engine Switch:
#         Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.

#         Server Certificate:
#         Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
#         the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
#         pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  Keep
#         in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you
#         can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA
#         ciphers, etc.)
        SSLCertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server.crt"
#         SSLCertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server-dsa.crt"

#         Server Private Key:
#         If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
#         directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
#         you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
#         both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
        SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server.key"
#         SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server-dsa.key"

#         Server Certificate Chain:
#         Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
#         concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
#         certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
#         the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
#         when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
#         certificate for convenience.
#         SSLCertificateChainFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server-ca.crt"

#         Certificate Authority (CA):
#         Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
#         certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
#         huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
#         Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks
#               to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
#               Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
#         SSLCACertificatePath "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt"
#         SSLCACertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/ca-bundle.crt"

#         Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
#         Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client
#         authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
#         of them (file must be PEM encoded)
#         Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks
#               to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
#               Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
#         SSLCARevocationPath "/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crl"
